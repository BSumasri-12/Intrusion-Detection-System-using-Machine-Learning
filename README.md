# Intrusion-Detection-System-using-Machine-Learning
This project builds an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using the UNSW-NB15 dataset, which includes modern attacks like DoS, Exploits, Fuzzers, and Generic. We trained ML models like Random Forest, KNN, and Gradient Boosting. Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy and was chosen as the final model.
